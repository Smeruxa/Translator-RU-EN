This can be used in games that have a "borderless" screen mode, which means a lot of popular games like: CS GO, Dota 2, Rocket League etc. You can copy the received text by double-clicking on the received text, as well as make a translation. To translate the text into Russian or English, you need to enter the desired text in the upper left corner, but the important point is that the text below means that you must enter the text in English, therefore the program will return the text in Russian as a result.
In this application, there is also a saving of the position and the last selected language, which is quite convenient.
